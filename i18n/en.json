It offers a secure, snug fit so finger notches are recommended when this foam is used. <strong>ProCell Foam</strong>is smooth with a suede-like consistent appearance.

It offers a secure, snug fit so finger notches are recommended when this foam is used. <strong>Ester foam</strong> is much more spongy and forgiving, exhibiting excellent shock absorption.
